# ReturnPal

In the fast-changing world of online shopping, businesses always want to know what's
happening and how to make the most of new opportunities. This project is all about online
retail, specifically focusing on ReturnPal, a company that helps people with online returns
to make it easier for them.

We're using data from 2017 to 2027, gathered from Statistica, to learn more about online
shopping trends. The main goal is to use Descriptive Analysis to uncover detailed patterns
in this big dataset. By exploring the data systematically, we want to give ReturnPal useful
insights so they can make smart choices for growing their business.

Our main focus is on figuring out what ReturnPal should pay attention to. We're not just
doing the usual analysis; we're digging deep into how the market works and what
customers are doing. By looking closely at the past, we hope to guide ReturnPal to find
the right partnerships that match what people want in the market now.

What makes this project special is that we're also looking ahead, using data up to 2027.
This forward-thinking view helps ReturnPal get ready for the future. It's like giving them a
map to understand where the market is going so they can use their resources wisely and
plan strategies to meet what customers will want in the future.

Our mission is clear: to give ReturnPal the knowledge they need to not just handle the
challenges of online shopping but also to get ahead and keep growing successfully in the
years to come.
